# recipeproject

Hello, my recipeApp project consists of homepage, detail page and favorites page. There is a search bar on the first page. When we write the names of the dishes or recipes and click the search button, we can reach the results from the database. There is an add to favorites button and a share button on the homepage.The detail page contains the ingredients and the health labels of the food. Again, when we click on the favorite button at the top of the homepage, it takes us to the favorites page. On this page, we list the products we have added to our favorites. When we slide the product to the right and left, we can remove it from the list. As requested in the project, getx was used as the state structure and the hive package was used as the database.
